In the VLSI-Design course during the Monsoon 2023 semester, I developed a 4-Bit ALU capable of performing Addition, Subtraction, Comparator, and ANDing operations for two 4-Bit numbers. The project involved using Verilog for logical design, Ngspice for transistor-level testing, and MAGIC Layout for physical implementation. The ALU's functionality was rigorously tested through GTK plots in Verilog, followed by NGSpice testing of MOSFET-designed gates. The final layout in MAGIC incorporated optimal placement and routing, with delay analysis ensuring efficiency in real-world applications. This project showcases a comprehensive integration of logical design, transistor-level testing, and physical layout considerations for a 4-Bit ALU.
